# 🚢 Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster

## 📌 Project Overview
This project is a comprehensive data analysis and machine learning solution for the famous [Titanic dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic). The goal is to predict passenger survival based on characteristics such as age, gender, class, and fare.

The project involves:
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to uncover trends and patterns.
- **Data Preprocessing** to clean and prepare the data.
- **Feature Engineering** to create meaningful variables.
- **Model Building** using Random Forest Classifier.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning** to optimize model performance.

## 📂 File Structure
- `titanic_analysis.ipynb`: The main Jupyter Notebook containing the code for analysis, visualization, and modeling.
- `Titanic-Dataset.csv`: The training dataset containing passenger details.
- `test.csv`: The test dataset for making predictions.
- `submission_tuned.csv`: The final predictions generated by the tuned model.
- `submission_score.png`: A screenshot or image showing the model's performance score.

## 🛠️ Technologies & Libraries Used
The project is implemented in **Python** using the following libraries:
- **Pandas** & **NumPy**: For data manipulation and numerical operations.
- **Matplotlib** & **Seaborn**: For data visualization.
- **DuckDB**: For SQL-based data querying.
- **Scikit-Learn**: For machine learning modeling (Random Forest, Grid Search, Metrics).

## 📊 Key Insights from EDA
- **Gender**: Women had a significantly higher survival rate (~74%) compared to men (~18%).
- **Class**: Passengers in 1st Class had a much better chance of survival compared to 2nd and 3rd Class.
- **Age**: Infants and young children were prioritized during the evacuation ("Women and children first").

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Ensure you have Python installed.
2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn duckdb
   ```
3. Open the notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook titanic_analysis.ipynb
   ```
4. Run all cells to see the analysis and train the model.

## 📈 Model Performance
The Random Forest Classifier was tuned using `GridSearchCV` to find the best hyperparameters. The final model achieves a competitive accuracy score on the test set.
